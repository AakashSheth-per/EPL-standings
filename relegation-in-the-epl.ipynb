A team can bounce back. It's just one season away from the big league, right? In reality though, its much different. Some of the things that happens after relegation:\n\n**Best players leave the club** - Think about it. The best (not faithful) players won't want to play in lower leagues. Some mid-table team will acquire services of your best player.\n\n**Becomes difficult to sign good players** - Inverse of the point above, no good player will want to join a team with average players in the second/third division.\n\n**Lack of sqaud depth** - Pretty obvious. If players leave and no one comes in, your squad size is bound to reduce. This takes a toll in the performances. How? In second tier of English football, the English League Championship (formally called First Division), you have two matches every week. With a trimmed squad, fatigue, tiredness and injuries begin to catch up on you.\n\n**Financial problems** - If you finish in relegation places, you lose on quite a lot of money. Ticket prices also need to be dropped in order to attract fans back to the stadium.\n\n**Psychological blow** - Not every team bounces back immediately. Look at Wigan Athletic and Sunderland. Relegation can act as a chain to further relegations.\n\nRelegation is like death. You can't help but weep in sorrow for the club that got relegated.\n\nIn this notebook, we will explore what leads teams to be relegated from the most prestigious league in the world using the R package dplyr and I'll share my takeaways at the end on how your club can avoid this dreadful fate.
