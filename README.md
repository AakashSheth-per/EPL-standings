20 Teams participate in the most fierce league in the world and everyone team has the goal to stay in top flight. 
However, it is difficult for each of them to maintain their tenure due to the term **Relegation**. Relegation are the bottom 3 teams and comes with heavy price.

**Best players leave the club** - Think about it. The best (not faithful) players won't want to play in lower leagues. Some mid-table team will acquire services of your best player.

**Becomes difficult to sign good players** - Inverse of the point above, no good player will want to join a team with average players in the second/third division.

**Lack of sqaud depth** - Pretty obvious. If players leave and no one comes in, your squad size is bound to reduce. This takes a toll in the performances. How? In second tier of English football, the English League Championship (formally called First Division), you have two matches every week. With a trimmed squad, fatigue, tiredness and injuries begin to catch up on you.

**Financial problems** - If you finish in relegation places, you lose on quite a lot of money. Ticket prices also need to be dropped in order to attract fans back to the stadium.

Relegation is like death. You can't help but weep in sorrow for the club that got relegated.

Then comes **The Big 6**
The big 6 has been constant in recent decade with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Spurs among the favorites. However, that wasn't the case at the beginning of the 21st Century. City was just born and struugling to keep up with the pace until 2008. 

6 teams battling for 4 UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE (UCL) spots is what makes this league deadly. 

# STEP2: **ANALYSIS THE TEAM**
The analysis of Relegation, average points of the relegated teams each season, how many times has a team been relegated, every aspect was done using R programming.
Similar terms, the UCL qualification spot contention teams, their average points, and how they fared in terms of relegated teams was also performed with Rstudio.

# STEP3: **VISUALISATION**
Once all the findings, and the analysis were on the table, time to break some bones and put it on Tableau to portray the rat race!
